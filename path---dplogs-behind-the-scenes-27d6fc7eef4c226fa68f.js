That'll also let me customize. I have used Blogger in the past and also written a Silverlight web application that was hosted on my school's servers.</p>\n<h2>Why React, not Angular ?</h2>\n<p>At first, I started looking into creating the MEAN stack and learning Angular 2. Each layer of the MEAN stack was created as a Docker image and deployed on Kubernetes. Then there were a few days when work got a little crazy. When I got back to it, Angular 4 was released. Though I hadn't done much with Angular 2, reading the new documentation felt as if I was starting all over with Angular 4. Meanwhile React had started to gain popularity and felt shiny new. The MEAN stack also started to feel as an overkill for just a blog, I'd have had to run it in a cloud infrastructure which could have cost me. I soon realized that similar to serving a Silverlight web application, I could host a static website serving the React app saving the hassle of maintaning the infrastructure. I figured, if I want to learn something new anyway, then why not pick the latest and greatest. After going through the concepts in the documentation and following few tutorials, I got a hang of React and it's been great !</p>\n<h2>The Stack</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Azure Application Insights (telemetry)</li>\n<li>Azure Storage - Blobs (content)</li>\n<li>Git (source control)</li>\n<li>Github (source control hosting service)</li>\n<li>Github Pages (static site hosting)</li>\n<li>React (UI framework)</li>\n<li>Ubuntu (development OS)</li>\n<li>Visual Studio Code (IDE)</li>\n<li>Visual Studio Team Services (work item tracking)</li>\n</ul>",frontmatter:{date:"Sunday October 01 2017 04:23:00 PM",path:"/dplogs_behind_the_scenes",title:"dplogs : behind the scenes",keywords:"react, UI, blog",description:"dplogs : behind the scenes",image_url:"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/557640083709251584/LmA6xXxv.png",image_alt:"behind the scenes",image_width:"445",image_height:"445"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
