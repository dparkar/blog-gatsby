For each of these n ids, I wanted the stored procedure to take each one of them and get a result set, all the result sets are then UNIONed together and returned as one result set. I wanted the parameters to the stored procedures work something like passing an array or like MethodName(params int[] parameterName)\nOne of the ways which this can be done, which I found really convenient is passing in XML as parameter to the stored procedure and then using "IN" in the SELECT statement.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-sql">ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetResultsUsingIds]\n@ids_xml Text\nAS\nBEGIN\n-- SET NOCOUNT ON added to prevent extra result sets from\n-- interfering with SELECT statements.\nSET NOCOUNT ON;\n \nDECLARE @hDoc int\n \nexec sp_xml_preparedocument @hDoc OUTPUT, @ids_xml\n \nBEGIN\n \nSELECT\n*\nFROM studenttable\nWHERE student_id IN\n(SELECT Id FROM OPENXML(@hDoc,\'/Ids/StudentId\',1) WITH(Id int))\n \nUNION ALL\n \nSELECT\n*\nFROM studenttable\nWHERE section_id IN\n(SELECT Id FROM OPENXML(@hDoc,\'/Ids/SectionId\',1) WITH(Id int))\n \nEND\n \nEXEC sp_xml_removedocument @hDoc\n \nEND\n</code></pre>\n<p>The input parameter for the above stored procedure may look like :</p>\n<p>ids_xml :</p>\n<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;ids>\n&#x3C;studentid id="1">&#x3C;/studentid>\n&#x3C;studentid id="2">&#x3C;/studentid>\n&#x3C;sectionid id="7">&#x3C;/sectionid>\n&#x3C;sectionid id="8">&#x3C;/sectionid>\n&#x3C;/ids>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Will return from student table:</p>\n<p>all result sets with student<em>Id as 1 + all result sets with student</em>Id as 2 + all result sets with section<em>Id as 7 + all result sets with section</em>Id as 8</p>\n<h2>sp<em>xml</em>preparedocument and sp<em>xml</em>removedocument</h2>\n<p><i>"Reads the XML text provided as input, parses the text by using the MSXML parser (Msxmlsql.dll), and provides the parsed document in a state ready for consumption.
