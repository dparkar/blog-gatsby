This may involve working with the Active Directory too. In this case make sure that an Anti-Virus is installed on the VM. Unless this is done Windows Updates and SharePoint install will not work as they need to connect to the internet and download files during installation.</p>\\n<p>If you don’t know what is a Firewall, please look <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>If you don’t know what is an Active Directory, please look <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory\\\">here</a></p>\\n<p>If you don’t require your VM to be on some internal network and just want the VM like an independent sandbox and your host machine has an independent internet connection, then all updates and downloads should work fine. Since we will take the snapshot of the VM when its clean and new(“Clean State”) before we start doing anything on it, we don’t really require an Anti-Virus since you can always set back your VM to the “Clean State”.\\nMake sure that once the installation of the OS is complete then do all the Windows Updates.</p>\\n<h2>Setting up shared folders between host and VM</h2>\\n<p>You might be still comfortable to use the internet connection and browser on your host machine to download files which can be required to install SharePoint 2010 or any other software you need on your VM. In that case you need to transfer your files from  your host machine to your VM. You need to set up a share folder between them.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Once the VM has started and you have come to your desktop on your VM. Click on the “Devices” menu on the window in which your VM is being run by VirtualBox. This window should be saying its name as “(…) [Running] – Sun VirtualBox”.</li>\\n<li>Click “Shared Folders”.</li>\\n<li>Click the plus folder icon on the top right, which will open up a dialog box asking you to choose a folder from your host machine which you would like to share with this VM. If you don’t already have a separate folder for this purpose, you can go ahead and make one on your host machine and then come back to this window and find the folder you just created by clicking on the down arrow on the Folder Path and then Clicking “Other”.\\nGive an appropriate folder name. </li>\\n<li>Click OK. If you choose read-only, it should reflect that access in the “Access” column.\\nIf you don’t know about File system permissions, please look <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions\\\">here</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<center><img src=\\\"https://dplogscontent.blob.core.windows.net/dplogs/blog_sharepoint_sharedfolder1.png\\\" width=\\\"50%\\\" height=\\\"50%\\\" /></center>\\n<center><img src=\\\"https://dplogscontent.blob.core.windows.net/dplogs/blog_sharepoint_sharedfolder2.png\\\" width=\\\"50%\\\" height=\\\"50%\\\" /></center>\\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\\n<li>Click OK.</li>\\n<li>In your VM, goto Control Panel and then to Network and Sharing Center and make sure that Network Discovery is on. Make it a private network.</li>\\n<li>In your VM, goto the windows explorer and type the following command.\\nnet use Z:\\\\vboxsvr\\\\ (Name of your shared folder)</li>\\n<li>Press enter.\\nIt will take you back to your “My Computer” and under Network Location you should see the folder you shared from your host machine mapped as drive letter Z. If this doesn’t happen then you manually need to map the Z letter to the shared folder.</li>\\n<li>Click on Map Network Drive in Explorer and choose the Drive as Z: and Folder can be chosen after browsing. Since your network discovery is on, you should be able to see VBOXSVR. Expand it and you will find your folder which you shared from your host OS.</li>\\n<li>Select this folder and Click OK. Then Click Finish.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Now you can see the shared folder under Network Location of your VM.\\nIf you don’t know about Drive letter mapping, please look <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_letter_assignment\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Install Guest Additions</h2>\\n<p>It will really make things convenient for you if you Install the Guest Additions by VirtualBox (especially with the mouse). </p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Click on “Devices”</li>\\n<li>Click on “Install Guest Additions”. </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Let it do its work. Make sure that when you click on “Install Guest Additions” you are on the desktop of your VM, else nothing will happen.</p>\\n<h2>Download and install WCF hotfix</h2>\\n<p>Before you actually install SharePoint Server 2010 on Windows Server 2008 SP2, you need to install the WCF HotFix (KB971831). It is provided by Microsoft and can be found <a href=\\\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkID=160770\\\">here</a>. You can download it straight away from your VM’s browser or download to your host machine, put it in your shared folder and then take it to your VM from your shared folder.</p>\\n<h2>Download Sharepoint Server 2010</h2>\\n<p>If you don’t have SharePoint Server 2010 installation file (called “OfficeServer.exe”), then you will need to go and download it from <a href=\\\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/ee388573.aspx\\\">here</a>. I chose the SharePoint Server 2010 (Enterprise Client Access License features) because I believe it’s the whole deal.\\nYou will get the product key of this software in your email which will be asked to you before you download.</p>\\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Once you get OfficeServer.exe on your VM, make a folder in your C: Drive called “SharePointFiles” and keep your OfficeServer.exe file in there.</li>\\n<li>Open Command Prompt and extract the SharePoint Files from OfficeServer.exe to the SharePointFiles folder.\\nTo do this, in the command prompt do the following :\\nc:\\\\SharePointFiles\\\\OfficeServer /extract:c:\\\\SharePointFiles\\nAll files will now be extracted to SharePointFiles.</li>\\n<li>If you Run Setup.exe in SharePointFiles you might get error of Hardware and Software Requirements if everything required is not there.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<center><img src=\\\"https://dplogscontent.blob.core.windows.net/dplogs/blog_sharepoint_office_pre_req.png\\\" width=\\\"50%\\\" height=\\\"50%\\\" /></center>\\n<h2>Installing pre-requisities (preparation tool)</h2>\\n<p>Run the Prerequisite Installer(Preparation Tool) before running the Setup.exe which will check and install all the required softwares for Sharepoint 2010 on Windows Server 2008 SP2.\\nIf at any given point, the Installation fails, you might want to check the log files to see what failed. Most of the time it might be that the installer was not able to download the required files. In this case you need to reset the network adapter. This can be done by going to Network and Sharing Center and clickin on View Status, then clicking on Diagnose. This might be happening only because of the fact that VM is using host internet connection and is not consistent.</p>\\n<h2>Installing Sharepoint Server 2010</h2>\\n<p>Then run Setup.exe. Choose Standalone. Since you are installing it on a VM, you can run multiple servers to give you the farm effect (Still have to work on that).\\nIf at any given point, the Installation fails, you might want to check the log files to see what failed. Most of the time it might be that the installer was not able to download the required files. In this case you need to reset the network adapter. This might be happening only because of the fact that VM is using host internet connection and is not consistent.\\nIf everything is runs fine and your SharePoint Server 2010 installation is complete, you should be brought to the “Configuration Wizard” window. WAIT. You need to install the SQL Server 2008 KB Hotfixes before you continue.  Let the wizard stay as it is in the background.</p>\\n<h2>Increase VHDD size</h2>\\n<p>If you have given a VHDD size lesser than what is required to install SharePoint(which happened to me initially, I had given only 20 GB) the installer will stop and say configuration failed.\\nThe ones which are already configured wont be rolled back, on restarting it will just continue from there.\\nTo increase the VHDD space. I believe there are many softwares out there (e.g. CloneZilla).You can refer VirtualBox Forums (Storage) <a href=\\\"http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?p=33945#33945\\\">here</a>\\nI tried using clonevdi (has an option to increase vdi size while cloning, but didn’t work for me) and researched and came across Gparted. But going through all that is way too much effort and time consuming , instead just do the whole thing all over again with enough space. You can go through all that pain if you have installed a lot of stuff on your VHDD and cannot risk deleting it. (Here we have only installed an OS on a VM as yet).\\nThis time make sure you have enough space on your host computer to dedicate atleast 80 GB for  VHDD (100GB to be safe).</p>\\n<h2>Download and Install SQL Server 2008 KB hotfixes</h2>\\n<p>Before you continue on the wizard, you need to get the SQL Server 2008 KB Hotfixes which will be emailed to you with passwords. They can be found <a href=\\\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970315\\\">here</a> (Click on View and request hotfix downloads)\\nGet these files on your VM and install them. There should be 2 hotfixes.</p>\\n<h2>Completing configuration wizard</h2>\\n<p>You can now go ahead and complete the Configuration Wizard.\\nYou will get to the website which you will asked to choose the template. You can choose what you like depending upon what you require it for or match it to your organization. I just made it Blank because I would like to custom build it.</p>\\n<h2>Development tools</h2>\\n<p>We are not done yet. To do any kind of development you will need to :</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Download and install Visual Studio 2010 which can be found <a href=\\\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/dd582936.aspx\\\">here</a>.

You want to save this state of the VM so that you can always revert to this “Clean State”. VirtualBox allows you to do that by taking a snapshot of the VM.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Clear your desktop and click on “Machine” menu on the window which is running your VM. </li>\\n<li>Click on “Take Snapshot”.</li>\\n<li>Enter this Snapshot’s name and description if you would like. </li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Click OK. You are all set and ready to play in the sandbox. If at any point of time you would like to come back to the “Clean State” of the VM :</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>When the VM is “Powered Off”. Click on the Snapshots tab. You should see that it says “Snapshots(1)”. </li>\\n<li>You can right click on the Snapshot name which you gave and click on “Restore Snapshot”.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><b>You're all set !</b></p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"March 04, 2010\",\"path\":\"/install_sharepoint_2010_in_virtual_box\",\"title\":\"Installing SharePoint Server 2010 in VirtualBox\"}}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---install-sharepoint-2010-in-virtual-box-e27ec55ed41d7d1fa88e.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<h1>Installing SharePoint Server 2010 in VirtualBox</h1>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Guest OS : Windows Server 2008 SP2 64-bit</li>\\n<li>Host OS : Windows 7 Enterprise 64-bit</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Installing SharePoint on a normal Windows Machine itself can be a bit messy, let alone installing it on a Virtual Machine (VM).</p>\\n<p>If you don’t know what is SharePoint, please look <a href=\\\"http://sharepoint2010.microsoft.com/Pages/default.aspx\\\">here</a> and it's <a href=\\\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee537319%28office.14%29.aspx\\\">conceptional overview</a>.</p>\\n<p>If you don’t know what is a Virtual Machine, please look <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>Developers prefer installing SharePoint on a VM since it requires a lot of other installations and configurations which are prerequisites to install SharePoint.

This may involve working with the Active Directory too. In this case make sure that an Anti-Virus is installed on the VM. Unless this is done Windows Updates and SharePoint install will not work as they need to connect to the internet and download files during installation.</p>\\n<p>If you don’t know what is a Firewall, please look <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<p>If you don’t know what is an Active Directory, please look <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory\\\">here</a></p>\\n<p>If you don’t require your VM to be on some internal network and just want the VM like an independent sandbox and your host machine has an independent internet connection, then all updates and downloads should work fine. Since we will take the snapshot of the VM when its clean and new(“Clean State”) before we start doing anything on it, we don’t really require an Anti-Virus since you can always set back your VM to the “Clean State”.\\nMake sure that once the installation of the OS is complete then do all the Windows Updates.</p>\\n<h2>Setting up shared folders between host and VM</h2>\\n<p>You might be still comfortable to use the internet connection and browser on your host machine to download files which can be required to install SharePoint 2010 or any other software you need on your VM. In that case you need to transfer your files from  your host machine to your VM. You need to set up a share folder between them.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Once the VM has started and you have come to your desktop on your VM. Click on the “Devices” menu on the window in which your VM is being run by VirtualBox. This window should be saying its name as “(…) [Running] – Sun VirtualBox”.</li>\\n<li>Click “Shared Folders”.</li>\\n<li>Click the plus folder icon on the top right, which will open up a dialog box asking you to choose a folder from your host machine which you would like to share with this VM. If you don’t already have a separate folder for this purpose, you can go ahead and make one on your host machine and then come back to this window and find the folder you just created by clicking on the down arrow on the Folder Path and then Clicking “Other”.\\nGive an appropriate folder name. </li>\\n<li>Click OK. If you choose read-only, it should reflect that access in the “Access” column.\\nIf you don’t know about File system permissions, please look <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions\\\">here</a></li>\\n</ol>\\n<center><img src=\\\"https://dplogscontent.blob.core.windows.net/dplogs/blog_sharepoint_sharedfolder1.png\\\" width=\\\"50%\\\" height=\\\"50%\\\" /></center>\\n<center><img src=\\\"https://dplogscontent.blob.core.windows.net/dplogs/blog_sharepoint_sharedfolder2.png\\\" width=\\\"50%\\\" height=\\\"50%\\\" /></center>\\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\\n<li>Click OK.</li>\\n<li>In your VM, goto Control Panel and then to Network and Sharing Center and make sure that Network Discovery is on. Make it a private network.</li>\\n<li>In your VM, goto the windows explorer and type the following command.\\nnet use Z:\\\\vboxsvr\\\\ (Name of your shared folder)</li>\\n<li>Press enter.\\nIt will take you back to your “My Computer” and under Network Location you should see the folder you shared from your host machine mapped as drive letter Z. If this doesn’t happen then you manually need to map the Z letter to the shared folder.</li>\\n<li>Click on Map Network Drive in Explorer and choose the Drive as Z: and Folder can be chosen after browsing. Since your network discovery is on, you should be able to see VBOXSVR. Expand it and you will find your folder which you shared from your host OS.</li>\\n<li>Select this folder and Click OK. Then Click Finish.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Now you can see the shared folder under Network Location of your VM.\\nIf you don’t know about Drive letter mapping, please look <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_letter_assignment\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Install Guest Additions</h2>\\n<p>It will really make things convenient for you if you Install the Guest Additions by VirtualBox (especially with the mouse). </p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Click on “Devices”</li>\\n<li>Click on “Install Guest Additions”. </li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Let it do its work. Make sure that when you click on “Install Guest Additions” you are on the desktop of your VM, else nothing will happen.</p>\\n<h2>Download and install WCF hotfix</h2>\\n<p>Before you actually install SharePoint Server 2010 on Windows Server 2008 SP2, you need to install the WCF HotFix (KB971831). It is provided by Microsoft and can be found <a href=\\\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkID=160770\\\">here</a>. You can download it straight away from your VM’s browser or download to your host machine, put it in your shared folder and then take it to your VM from your shared folder.</p>\\n<h2>Download Sharepoint Server 2010</h2>\\n<p>If you don’t have SharePoint Server 2010 installation file (called “OfficeServer.exe”), then you will need to go and download it from <a href=\\\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/ee388573.aspx\\\">here</a>. I chose the SharePoint Server 2010 (Enterprise Client Access License features) because I believe it’s the whole deal.\\nYou will get the product key of this software in your email which will be asked to you before you download.</p>\\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Once you get OfficeServer.exe on your VM, make a folder in your C: Drive called “SharePointFiles” and keep your OfficeServer.exe file in there.</li>\\n<li>Open Command Prompt and extract the SharePoint Files from OfficeServer.exe to the SharePointFiles folder.\\nTo do this, in the command prompt do the following :\\nc:\\\\SharePointFiles\\\\OfficeServer /extract:c:\\\\SharePointFiles\\nAll files will now be extracted to SharePointFiles.</li>\\n<li>If you Run Setup.exe in SharePointFiles you might get error of Hardware and Software Requirements if everything required is not there.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<center><img src=\\\"https://dplogscontent.blob.core.windows.net/dplogs/blog_sharepoint_office_pre_req.png\\\" width=\\\"50%\\\" height=\\\"50%\\\" /></center>\\n<h2>Installing pre-requisities (preparation tool)</h2>\\n<p>Run the Prerequisite Installer(Preparation Tool) before running the Setup.exe which will check and install all the required softwares for Sharepoint 2010 on Windows Server 2008 SP2.\\nIf at any given point, the Installation fails, you might want to check the log files to see what failed. Most of the time it might be that the installer was not able to download the required files. In this case you need to reset the network adapter. This can be done by going to Network and Sharing Center and clickin on View Status, then clicking on Diagnose. This might be happening only because of the fact that VM is using host internet connection and is not consistent.</p>\\n<h2>Installing Sharepoint Server 2010</h2>\\n<p>Then run Setup.exe. Choose Standalone. Since you are installing it on a VM, you can run multiple servers to give you the farm effect (Still have to work on that).\\nIf at any given point, the Installation fails, you might want to check the log files to see what failed. Most of the time it might be that the installer was not able to download the required files. In this case you need to reset the network adapter. This might be happening only because of the fact that VM is using host internet connection and is not consistent.\\nIf everything is runs fine and your SharePoint Server 2010 installation is complete, you should be brought to the “Configuration Wizard” window. WAIT. You need to install the SQL Server 2008 KB Hotfixes before you continue.  Let the wizard stay as it is in the background.</p>\\n<h2>Increase VHDD size</h2>\\n<p>If you have given a VHDD size lesser than what is required to install SharePoint(which happened to me initially, I had given only 20 GB) the installer will stop and say configuration failed.\\nThe ones which are already configured wont be rolled back, on restarting it will just continue from there.\\nTo increase the VHDD space. I believe there are many softwares out there (e.g. CloneZilla).You can refer VirtualBox Forums (Storage) <a href=\\\"http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?p=33945#33945\\\">here</a>\\nI tried using clonevdi (has an option to increase vdi size while cloning, but didn’t work for me) and researched and came across Gparted. But going through all that is way too much effort and time consuming , instead just do the whole thing all over again with enough space. You can go through all that pain if you have installed a lot of stuff on your VHDD and cannot risk deleting it. (Here we have only installed an OS on a VM as yet).\\nThis time make sure you have enough space on your host computer to dedicate atleast 80 GB for  VHDD (100GB to be safe).</p>\\n<h2>Download and Install SQL Server 2008 KB hotfixes</h2>\\n<p>Before you continue on the wizard, you need to get the SQL Server 2008 KB Hotfixes which will be emailed to you with passwords. They can be found <a href=\\\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970315\\\">here</a> (Click on View and request hotfix downloads)\\nGet these files on your VM and install them. There should be 2 hotfixes.</p>\\n<h2>Completing configuration wizard</h2>\\n<p>You can now go ahead and complete the Configuration Wizard.\\nYou will get to the website which you will asked to choose the template. You can choose what you like depending upon what you require it for or match it to your organization. I just made it Blank because I would like to custom build it.</p>\\n<h2>Development tools</h2>\\n<p>We are not done yet. To do any kind of development you will need to :</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Download and install Visual Studio 2010 which can be found <a href=\\\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/dd582936.aspx\\\">here</a>. I installed Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate RC.</li>\\n<li>Download and install the Microsoft SharePoint Platform SDK which can be found <a href=\\\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/default.aspx\\\">here</a>.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<h2>Taking a snapshot of VM</h2>\\n<p>Now that all the installation is done. You want to save this state of the VM so that you can always revert to this “Clean State”. VirtualBox allows you to do that by taking a snapshot of the VM.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Clear your desktop and click on “Machine” menu on the window which is running your VM. </li>\\n<li>Click on “Take Snapshot”.</li>\\n<li>Enter this Snapshot’s name and description if you would like. </li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Click OK. You are all set and ready to play in the sandbox. If at any point of time you would like to come back to the “Clean State” of the VM :</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>When the VM is “Powered Off”. Click on the Snapshots tab. You should see that it says “Snapshots(1)”. </li>\\n<li>You can right click on the Snapshot name which you gave and click on “Restore Snapshot”.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><b>You're all set !</b></p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"date\":\"March 04, 2010\",\"path\":\"/install_sharepoint_2010_in_virtual_box\",\"title\":\"Installing SharePoint Server 2010 in VirtualBox\"}}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/install-sharepoint-2010-in-virtual-box.json\n// module id = 352\n// module chunks = 240471943383828"],"sourceRoot":""}
